# 'Outsystems Integration' Extension roadmap
With this initial versions from the 'Outsystems integration' extensionWith a very successful 2016 behind us, now is the good time to look towards the future. We typically look out 6 to 12 months, establish a set of themes we want to work towards, and then schedule work each milestone supporting those themes. When planning, we typically look at potential work from three perspectives:

### Collect feedback
* [x] Identify issues and request, suggestions from Outsystems and Team Services/TFS users
* [x] Help deployment/usage in some key Outsystems enterprise customers 

### Define Roadmap
* [x] Identify other use cases of DevOps integration with Outsystem platform
* [x] Work with Outsystems product teams and help building a roadmap from Outsystems APIs standpoint
* Identify and resolve setting conflicts

### Contribute to Extensions
* üèÉ [GO](https://github.com/OutSystems/vsts-go)
* üèÉ [Docker](https://github.com/OutSystems/vsts-docker)

## Summary
These are examples of just some of the work we will be focusing on in the next 6 to 12 months. We continuously tune the plan based on feedback and we will provide more detail in each of our monthly iteration plans. Please follow along and let us know what you think!
